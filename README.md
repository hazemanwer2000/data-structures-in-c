# Data Structures in C
Optimized, well-documented, dynamic **Data Structures**, ready for use, C99+ compatible.

- **List**
  - Implemented using a *Linked List*.
  - Supports *Stack* and *Queue* operations.

- **Sorted List**
  - Implemented using an *AVL Binary Search Tree*.
  - Supports unbalanced *BST* operations.

***Notes:***

- All procedures are optimized to run *iteratively*, and not recursively.
- The data type of choice is `void *`, for maximum generality.
- Structures and function pointers are utilized where possible, to increase code modularity.

For a brief refresher on the C language (89, 99, 11), check out my [*Brief Summary of C*](brief_summary_of_c.ipynb) *Jupyter* notebook, that uses Brendan Rius's *Minimal C Kernel* to compile and run examples.

Additionally, check out my [*Data Structures and Algorithms*](data_structures_and_algorithms.ipynb) *Jupyter* notebook, where I elaborate on many searching and sorting algorithms, as well as, data structures, and provide insight in how they might be implemented (in C).
