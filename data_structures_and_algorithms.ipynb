The *height* of a tree is the maximum depth of any of its nodes. The *degree* of any node is the number of children it possesses.\n",

Binary trees can be used to naturally represent sorted lists, since binary insertion and search is built-in to the data structure. When used in this capacity, a binary tree is renamed *binary search tree* (BST). For example, a sorted binary tree of integers, during insertion, would compare the new value to the value at the root node. If smaller, then the value must be stored at a node to the left of the root node, and vice versa.\n",

Implementing a BST dynamically on the heap would be a wiser choice.\n",
